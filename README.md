# **QOSF Mentorship Assessment Task**



## **Assessment Question:**

Find the lowest eigenvalue of the following matrix:

**[[ 1	0	0	0 ]**
 **[  0	0  -1	0 ]**
 **[  0   -1   0	0 ]**
 **[  0	0   0    1 ]]**

using VQE-like circuits, created by yourself from scratch.



## **Assessment Solution:**

My solution involves usage of Qiskit platform and is based on a very generalizable approach, i.e., not restrictive to the current Hamiltonian itself and can be outlined as follows:
1. Hamiltonian in Pauli Basis
2. Calculations of Expectation Value
3. Designing Ansatze
4. Running Simulations
5. Running Noisy Simulations
6. Extension to Excited Energy States
7. Interpreting the Results
