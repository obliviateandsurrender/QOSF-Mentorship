# **QOSF Mentorship Assessment Task**



## **Question - Task 4**:

Find the lowest eigenvalue of the following matrix:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0  \\
0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\
0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}.
$$

using VQE-like circuits, created by yourself from scratch.

## **Solution**:

My solution involves usage of Qiskit platform and is outlined as follows:


1.   Hamiltonian in Pauli Basis
2.   Calculations of Expectation Value
3.   Designing Ansatze
4.   Running Simulations
5.   Extension to Excited Energy States
6.   Interpreting the Results
